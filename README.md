## Hello! My name is Michelle and I'm an aspiring Cybersecurity Analyst.


After completing the Google Cybersecurity certificate, I've begun pursuing CompTIA Security+ certification while seeking entry-level SOC Analyst opportunities. I'm looking forward to getting involved in CTF for some gamefied learning, and setting up a home lab for some sandbox practice as I go. From there, I'll be going deeper into Python and exploring the nexus where AI and cybersecurity intersect. I love to learn.
